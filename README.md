# Professor Thomas Sinclair supervises this project
The people working on this project are Darshini Rajamani, Abbas Dohadwala, Luke Luschwitz, and Karim El-Sharkawy of Purdue University (LinkedIn profiles below)

# Our goals
We have successfully completed our initial goal of making code that finds if a matrix is extendable or not. we now have other goals to achieve, that being finding extremities, plotting the shapes of the extreme points, and others.

We plan to make a working code and focus on elegance later on. We're using Python and NumPy, Random, and SciPy (specifically linprog), and sklearn.

# What we're doing to meet those goals
+ Working together to compute the code and understand the theory. Some are focusing on theory while others are focusing on code
+ reading the professor's notes and making sure we understand our code
+ adding many comments everywhere so we know exactly what everything does and anyone reading the code can also understand it

# File information
1. Creating Extendable... = Finds a large number of mappings, some extendable and others not, then uses ML (sklearn.logisticregression) to get closer to our goal
2. (Non)ExtendableMappings.npy = two files of extendable and non-extendable mappings generated by the first file. These are 4000 mappings in total
