# Professor Thomas Sinclair supervises this project
Contributors of this project are Darshini Rajamani, Abbas Dohadwala, Luke Luschwitz, and Karim El-Sharkawy of Purdue University (contacts below)

# Our goals
We have successfully completed our initial goal of making code that finds if a matrix is extendable or not. we now have other goals to achieve, that being finding extremities, plotting the shapes of the extreme points, and others.

We plan to make a working code and focus on elegance later on. We're using Python and NumPy, Random, and SciPy (specifically linprog), and sklearn.

# What we're doing to meet those goals
+ Working together to compute the code and understand the theory. Abbas and Karim are focusing on theory while Luke and Darshini are focusing mainly on the code
+ reading the professor's notes and making sure we understand our code by doing a lot of reading and understanding what the computer is giving us
+ adding many comments everywhere so we know exactly what everything does and anyone reading the code can also understand it

# File information
1. Creating_Extendable_and_Nonextendable_Maps.ipynb: Finds a large number of mappings, some extendable and others not, then uses ML (sklearn.logisticregression) to get closer to our goal
2. Data Sets Folder:
- (Non)ExtendableMappings: two files of extendable and non-extendable mappings (100k total) generated by the first file. 
- farthestBsMORE: lists the farthest nonextendable mappings from the extendable mappings
- trueClassifiersGood: lists the best classifiers
- The other files in the folder are not of importance right now 
3. Project Guide: A guide for anyone wanting to catch up with the project or understand the entire process. Can be used as a guide or a resource to refresh
