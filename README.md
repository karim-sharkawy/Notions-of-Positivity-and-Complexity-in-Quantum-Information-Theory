# Professor Thomas Sinclair supervises this project
The people working on this project are Darshini Rajamani, Abbas Dohadwala, Luke Luschwitz, and Karim El-Sharkawy of Purdue University

# Our goals
We are currently working on computing code that can find a liftable and extendable

# What we're doing to meet those goals
We are currently working together to compute the code and understand the theory. Some are focusing on theory while others are focusing on code so we may work with what we do best

# Information on the files
1. test3 = code that creates a positive semidefinite matrix
2. checktest2 = (currently working on this). Tries to find if the matrix is liftable or extendable
