# Overview
This project is supervised by [Thomas Sinclair](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~tsincla/) of Purdue Mathematics. Contributors of this project are [Darshini Rajamani](//www.linkedin.com/in/darshini-rajamani/), [Abbas Dohadwala](//www.linkedin.com/in/abbas-dohadwala-74872b289/), [Luke Luschwitz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-luschwitz/), and [Karim El-Sharkawy](//www.linkedin.com/in/karimme/) of Purdue University

# Our goals
We have successfully completed our initial goal of making code that finds if a matrix is extendable or not. we now have other goals to achieve, that being finding extremities, plotting the shapes of the extreme points, and others. We plan to make a working code and focus on elegance later on. We're using Python with NumPy, SciPy (specifically linprog), and sklearn libraries.

# What we're doing to meet those goals
+ Working together to compute the code and understand the theory. Communicating with each other to accurately translate the theory into code
+ reading the professor's notes and making sure we understand our code by doing a lot of reading and understanding what the computer is giving us
+ adding many comments everywhere so we know exactly what everything does and anyone reading the code can also understand it

# File information
1. Creating_Extendable_and_Nonextendable_Maps.ipynb: Finds a large number of mappings, some extendable and others not, then uses ML (sklearn.logisticregression) to get closer to our goal
2. Data Sets Folder
- (Non)ExtendableMappings: two files of extendable and non-extendable mappings (100k total) generated by the first file. 
- farthestBsMORE: lists the farthest nonextendable mappings from the extendable mappings
- trueClassifiersGood: lists the best classifiers
3. Project Guide: A guide for anyone wanting to catch up with the project or understand the entire process. Can be used as a guide or a resource to refresh
