# Professor Thomas Sinclair supervises this project
The people working on this project are Darshini Rajamani, Abbas Dohadwala, Luke Luschwitz, and Karim El-Sharkawy of Purdue University

# Our goals
We have successfully completed the our initial goal of making code that finds if a matrix is extendable or not. we now have other goals to achieve, that being finding extremities, plotting the shapes of the extreme points, and others.

We plan to make a working code and focus on elegance later on. We're using Python and NumPy, Random, and SciPy (specifically linprog).

# What we're doing to meet those goals
+ Working together to compute the code and understand the theory. Some are focusing on theory while others are focusing on code
+ reading the professor's notes and making sure we understand our code
+ adding many comments everywhere so we know exactly what everything does and anyone reading the code can also understand it

# File information
1. test3 = code that creates a positive semidefinite matrix
2. checktest2 = (currently working on this). Tries to find if the matrix is liftable or extendable
3. ...
4. ...

# Extra information
Note from Karim: Each and every single member of this team is helping immensely with coding and understanding. It seems like I'm contributing the most based on activity, but this is because I usually take the new code and upload/update it.
- to give an example, I uploaded test3, but it was entirely worked on by Darshini
