# Professor Thomas Sinclair supervises this project
The people working on this project are Darshini Rajamani, Abbas Dohadwala, Luke Luschwitz, and Karim El-Sharkawy of Purdue University

# Our goals
We're working on computing code that can find a liftable and extendable matrix. We have longer-term goals, but working on the short ones right now. We are testing our code with simple examples that we know will always give us a certain output to ensure there are no bugs in the code.

We plan to make a working code and focus on elegance later on. We're using Python and NumPy, Random, and SciPy (specifically linprog).

# What we're doing to meet those goals
+ Working together to compute the code and understand the theory. Some are focusing on theory while others are focusing on code
+ reading the professor's notes and making sure we understand our code
+ adding many comments everywhere so we know exactly what everything does and anyone reading the code can also understand it

# Extra information
Note from Karim: Each and every single member of this team is helping immensely with coding and understanding. It seems like I'm contributing the most based on activity, but this is because I usually take the new code and upload/update it.
