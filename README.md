# Professor Thomas Sinclair supervises this project
The people working on this project are Darshini Rajamani, Abbas Dohadwala, Luke Luschwitz, and Karim El-Sharkawy of Purdue University

# Our goals
We're working on computing code that can find a liftable and extendable matrix. We have longer-term goals, but working on the short ones right now. We are testing our code with simple examples that we know will always give us a certain output so that we can make sure there's no bugs in the code.

We plan to make a working code and focus on elegance later on. We're using Python along with NumPy, Random, and SciPy (specifically scipy.linprog).

# What we're doing to meet those goals
We are currently working together to compute the code and understand the theory. Some are focusing on theory while others are focusing on code so we may work with what we do best

# File information

2. checktest2 = (currently working on this). Tries to find if the matrix is liftable or extendable
